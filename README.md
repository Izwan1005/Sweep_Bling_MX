# Ferris Sweep by @zwn.a

## 🌀 Description

**Wireless Ferris Sweep** with a twist. Each half of the case is designed to accommodate **two 401230 LiPo batteries (150mAh)** — one beneath the MCU and another under the palm rest. Why? Well... why not?  
More batteries = more power. More power = more fun. ⚡

## 🎮 Supported Controllers

- **RP2040**
- **Supermini NRF52840**

## 🔧 Firmware Options

I wrote two firmwares for it:

- **QMK-VIAL**
